    Q1. How can the weight (layout_weight) attribute be helpful ?
    In this exercise, the layout weight attribute is used to assign sizes by proportion
    (screen %) for the 2 image views. The root ViewGroup (LinearLayout - vertical) has
    the (optional) attribute (weightSum = "4") which indicates that the parent total
    size (in this case, height) will be divided between the children in 4 sections
    that are later allocated as 1 and 3 respectively (25 - 75 %).

    Q2. Can the layout_weight attribute be used in all ViewGroups ?
    No, it has no effect on the RelativeLayout.

    Q3. What would the weight-values of each View be if the Views were to be evenly
    distributed (considering a size of 0dp for all Views) ?
    If the Views were to be evenly distributed, the layout_weight values for each
    View would have to be 1 (or an equal value for each, say 2 - 2).
